# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
### A summary of the Pewlett Hackard Project:

##### I was tasked with using SQL to create quires that would combine and filter six CSV files to determine two things. The first task was to determine the number of retiring employees per title in the company, so how many assistant managers and salesmen were looking to potentially retire soon. My second task was to identify potential employees that could transition into a part time position and act in a mentorship capacity instead of retiring completely. 


## Pewlett-Hackard Results
### Creating table for employees who are retiring

##### After parsing through the CSV files and creating new table I discovered four things:
* There are 1549 employees who may qualify for the mentorship program.

* There have been 90398 employees whose birth date is between '1952-01-01' and '1955-12-31.'

* Many employees have held multiple positions and been promoted several times. 
* Many employees have not seen very much increases in their wages.
## Pewlett-Hackard Summary
### Avoiding the “silver tsunami”:

##### In the history of Pewlett Hackard there have been 90398 employees who may be on the verge of retiring, which is a lot of potential roles the company may have to fulfil. After looking through the data here are 1549 potential employees for the mentorship, or roughly 1.7% of the staff the company may see retiring soon. Many of them have had many hats over the years with the company therefor would be invaluable as mentors to several different roles. One mentor for every 50 new employees that need to be hired and trained will be a stretch.  I would recommend expanding the potential pool of mentors to avoid them being overwhelmed.
